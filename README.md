Cryptocurrency portfolio tracker. This app (and backend using Firebase) was made for a client who wanted to track his cryptocurrency portfolio. Unfortunately, the client didn't want to continue with the project, so I decided to make it open source after 3 years to serve as an example of an app I built from start to finish with design created in Figma. Feel free to use it as a learning material.
